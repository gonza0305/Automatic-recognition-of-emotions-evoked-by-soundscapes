# Automatic recognition of emotions evoked by soundscapes
> Additional information:

Performance evaluation using different machine learning models, using the Emo-soundscapes database for predicting the arousal valence values using the 1213 audio files. Additional information of the database can be found at http://metacreation.net/emo-soundscapes/

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
!pip install librosa
!pip install xgboost
!pip install keras
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install GPy 
```

The code above is included in the .ipynb file of the project, and it install the required libraries for executing the project


## Features

* Evaluation of machine learning models using handcrafted audio features
* Analysis and selection of the most important features of sounds in order to improve the accuracy of the valence arousal values predicted
* Design and tuning of a CNN using the log-el spectrogram of the audio files
